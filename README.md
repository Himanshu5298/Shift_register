The Shift Register is a sequential device that loads the data from its inputs and then "shifts" it once every clock cycle to its output.
Another sequential logic device that may be used to store or transmit binary data is the shift register. 
Several single bit "D-Type flip flops," one for each data bit, either a logic "0" or "1," are coupled together in a serial typeÂ configuration to form a shift register. The output from one flip-flop becomes the input of the next flip-flop, and so on.
The amount of bits to be stored often determines how many separate data latches are needed to build a single Shift Register device. 
It is a 8 bit Serial In Serial Out type of shift register.
